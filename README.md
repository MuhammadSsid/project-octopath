Project Octopath
================
Hello there lovely people! This is a little web crawler project, something tasty, something small.
This project uses BeautifulSoup along with standard python libraries to produce a formatted document containing content crawled from a website. Ive tried not to use any frameworks (Cause then it wouldn't be much of a challenge would it) and focus on getting the key requirements running in the base code.


Setup instructions
------------------

Run setup.sh as root
